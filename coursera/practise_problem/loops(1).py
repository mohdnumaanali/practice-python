# 🔄 Introduction to Loops
# A loop is simply a way to tell the computer: "Don't stop doing this until I say so."

# There are two main types of loops in Python:
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# while loops: These run as long as a condition is True (like a "While the light is green, keep driving" rule).

# for loops: These run for a set number of times (like a "Do 10 pushups" rule).
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#while loop example 1 

n = 5
while n > 0:
    print(n)
    n = n - 1  # This is the most important line!
print("Blast off!")
